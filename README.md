Quick dashboard demo
--------------------

A small Flask dashboard is available at `dashboard/app.py`. It uses the `DivineSupremeDebtPredictor` to visualize historical public debt and a light ensemble prediction.

- To run locally (development):

```powershell
# from repository root
python -m dashboard.app
```

- The notebook `notebooks/Divine_Debt_Dashboard_demo.ipynb` demonstrates the same pipeline inside a notebook.
